  coverLetter: `Dear next ex boss,

For me to share who I am in my own words is to define devils advocate. For my entire career I have worked most Saturdays and typically love what I do. I like to think that perspective is a personal fine tuning superpower that will allow anyone to find a place for passion in the minutia. Although typically considered a serious person I dont take myself so seriously that others find it difficult to.

Authorized to work in the US for any employer`,

        "Our small but mighty team tackles lending with a personal approach. At NorCapital we know that lending shouldn't only happen between 9-5. We encourage industry professionals, investors, and homeowners to give us a call. We make ourselves available in real time to our clients and partners. You won't have a 15-minute Q+A with a phone robot you will get solutions for all personal and client facing scenarios. Starting the journey like most do and purchased leads. That was done once and never again shifting focus away from sales to find a more efficient way than the horribly executed practice of mortgage lead sales. Developed the process flow from origin purchase of data from data focusing a needs based approach and value proposition for multiple data points at the time of acquisition. Furthermore taking time to parse and distill the potency of the value to the point where knowing my lists were simple. Developed an ethical mobile first platform leveraging cutting edge ai based transcript technology and further developed sentiment based follow up and rehash schedules based on keywords and conversation flow. Evolved the process from a serval hundred dollar unqualified lead purchase. Typically these expensive leads were full of errors and deliberate misinformation to consistent clients with genuine need and market opportunity costing $00.09 including first contact.",

        "Coming from the strict corporation, all self developed or simply overpaying for underperforming tech. convinced there was a better way. A web app way an API way an integrated way that did not include the major players in the space. Taking what i know from my now 20 years professionally behind a keyboard i had a clean canvas and the go ahead to build the system I always dreamed could be possible. What followed was test after test culminating in a Broker stack including telephony fully integrated with email transcription LOS, Property profiles and title workflow that even though I did not meet my target of under $100 per seat for 5 seats we managed well under $150 and had a chance to grow with great companies that are now industry mainstays. integration done at my desk internally or in concert with devs at the respective corporations from vender to vendor. Essentially anyone with the background is sales and sales that I do typically doesn't obsess about technology whats possible. Anyone that has ever told me that something is not possible platform wise will tell you I will never accept that as a response if your attempts to make it possible are equally unconvincing.",
