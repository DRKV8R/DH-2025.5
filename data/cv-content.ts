  coverLetter: `As a director a few times over in both publicly traded and start up financial services and software companies I aim to bring a unique and valuable perspective to your team having the ability to access interact and train models with no guardrails, & no filter. This makes me uniquely qualified to speak to the assumptions, capabilities and shortcomings of modern AI.

Personally and privately I have trained and fine tuned over 50 models to date both adult chat and simply unaligned or non bias data implementation. This is something that I believe will be one thing that hinders AI. Alignment is to carry our opinions as its own instead of forming unique insights. This is obvious in science and medical research but is just as true in simple conversations. 

In this short time occupying this planet I chose not to take myself so seriously that I'm blinded to nuance in experience. There are seemingly infinite points of view in any situation placing high value in individuality and conformity alike. There is an inherent danger in cultivating and developing something to be smarter than creator.

In my previous roles, I have honed my skills in data analysis, project management, and team leadership. I have a proven track record of leveraging novel data sets to drive strategic decision making and enhanced customer experiences. In every scenario where I work for a company I have approached the end goal with a company first mindset making the company I chose to represent extremely important. 

With that said I am eager to discuss how my background in AI development, finance, and customer experience mixed with insane work ethic can contribute to the continued success of your vision. Thank you for your careful consideration.

Carpe Diem,
David Hamilton`,
